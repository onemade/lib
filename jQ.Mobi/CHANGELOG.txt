There are CSS file fixes from the 1.1 release, so please update your css files.


Fixes

jq.mobi.js

 -Added .prop() and .removeProp() for accessing properties on an object
- Changed $.feat.nativeTouchScroll detection
- $.trigger now passes in object for scope of "this"
- $.unbind allows you to remove all when no function handler is passed

plugins/jq.scroller.js

- friendlier setup for native scrolling on divs (applies correct css properties to the divs)
- Fixed requirement of jq.touchlayer.js
- Fixed pull to refresh using native scrolling (no longer triggers on every pull)
- added scroller.setRefreshContent() function to change the text in pull to refresh
- changed js scroller touch move to only show opacity first time

plugins/jq.touchLayer.js
- fixed input jumping on iOS when using "next" or "previous" on keyboard

ui/src/jq.ui.js

- added setBackButtonVisibility that looks for #backButton, instead of static element (which can be lost for custom headers)
- fixed popstate issue on Chrome on iOS and links not triggered by jqUi
- fixed issue when loading panels via Ajax and specifying the id on the panel (could not navigate to them anymore)
- addDivAndScroll now has a fourth parameter "container"
- addDivAndScroll now again looks for "scrolling='no'" attribute
- addDivAndScroll removes custom data attributes on cloned div for js scrolling
- fixed "that is not defined" in parseScriptTags
- loadContent now looks for data-crc attribute when loading via Ajax to see if a panel was added, data-persist-ajax was set to true and trying to load it via ID
- loadContent now passes in an empty anchor if none is found for loadAjax
- modal div is now prepended to jqUi div so query selector finds those elements first
- fixed loading default panel in launch
- checkAnchorClick fix - now handles customClickHandler again.
- checkAnchorClick fix - allow tel: links to work (needed for UIWebView)

plugins/jq.touchLayer.js
- fixed double click issue (add back detection to see if second click actually moved)
